<p>This project is for Revolut users from Romania who invested in gold, silver or platinum.<br />The project is monitoring the precious metals price at Bloomberg/Galmarley, and it's using some formula to approximate the metal price at Revolut. If the price of the metal is so high so your profit would match a logical expression that you provided, then the application would notify you by email. Also the users could check whenever they want their profit by calling an API. The project is in developing phase.</p>
